# Oi! IC! Close NOW! I'm Warning You!
## Description:
This Addon applies successively more drastic measures to force the Idle Champions client to close when asked. The vanilla steps, WM_CLOSE (saving and exiting normally) and WinKill (very basic force close), are essentially unaltered. If those fail it enacts harsher measures.

MOST PEOPLE SHOULD NOT NEED THIS. The author experienced some game locks where the vanilla measures were unable to close the client and it would remain stuck indefinitely. This Addon was written in hopes of remedying that. As of writing this README, it is unknown if the more drastic measures will actually fix that issue. However, they have been tested to make sure they do force close the client under normal circumstances and are reputedly more potent than the vanilla measures.
